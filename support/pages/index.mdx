# BA6 Bluesky Suite

Automation + ops console for Bluesky posting. Schedule posts, manage accounts, track worker health, and audit what happened — without living inside the app 24/7.

BA6 is built like infrastructure: clear rules, observable pipelines, and predictable execution.

## What BA6 Includes

### Scheduling Engine

A queue‑based scheduler that turns “I’ll post later” into reliable execution.

**Core capabilities**

- Schedule posts for exact timestamps
- Retry + backoff on failures
- Locking so multiple workers don’t double‑post
- Clear states: queued → posting → posted / failed / canceled

**Why it matters**
Posting becomes a background process, not a daily manual routine.

  <strong>Scheduler pipeline:</strong> Draft → Scheduled → Claimed → Posted → Audited
</div>

### Drafts Workspace

A drafts area that separates writing from publishing.

**Core capabilities**

- Save drafts before scheduling
- Lightweight organization for planned content
- Works even if you haven’t linked a Bluesky account yet (optional wiring)

### Account Management

Connect one or more Bluesky identities and manage status.

**Core capabilities**

- Add / remove identities
- Track last auth time
- Mark an account active/inactive
- Safer separation between users (multi‑tenant by `user_id` + RLS)

**Note**
BA6 is designed for teams: accounts and data stay scoped to the signed‑in user.

### Direct Messages

Send and receive Bluesky DMs from inside BA6 once your Bluesky session is connected.

**Core capabilities**

- Conversation list + message threads
- New message flow (by @handle, DID, or BA6 username)
- Delivery status and read tracking

**Note**
Bluesky DMs require an active Bluesky session. If you see a “Connect Bluesky” prompt, finish the account connection first.

### BA6 Usernames

Optional app‑local usernames for display and quick mentions inside BA6.

**Core capabilities**

- Globally unique and case‑insensitive
- Maps directly to your DID (auth stays DID‑first)
- Useful for DM routing and collaboration

### Ops Console (Dashboard)

A live view of what the system is doing.

**Core capabilities**

- Worker heartbeat monitoring
- Scheduled post counts by status
- Event history (audit trail)
- “What’s broken?” visibility instead of guessing

### Audit + Events

A timeline of system actions.

**Core capabilities**

- Records what happened, when, and why
- Useful for debugging failed posts or suspicious behavior
- Makes the system observable (not a black box)

### Multi‑User Workspaces

BA6 is built to support multiple users safely.

**How it’s enforced**

- Every table keyed by `user_id`
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce separation
- Service role used only for worker actions (server‑side)

### Public Status + Health

BA6 exposes health endpoints for monitoring.

**Endpoints**

- `/healthz` → simple “ok”
- `/__version` → commit + timestamp (deployment sanity check)

## Modules Overview (no Feeds)

Below is a systems map of BA6 modules and what each one does.

### 1) Dashboard (Web App)

**Purpose:** user interface for scheduling, accounts, drafts, and ops visibility.

**Key pages:** Overview, Scheduled, Drafts, Events, Accounts.

**Current focus improvements**

- Mobile layout + safe‑area spacing
- Better navigation behavior on iOS browser toolbars

### 2) Worker (Scheduler)

**Purpose:** background process that claims queued jobs and posts at the right time.

**Responsibilities**

- Claim jobs using RPC lock
- Transition statuses
- Retry & record errors
- Write post events for audit trail

### 3) Database (Supabase)

**Purpose:** durable storage + security boundary.

**Responsibilities**

- User profiles + accounts
- Drafts + scheduled posts
- Events + worker heartbeats
- RLS policies (multi‑user isolation)

### 4) Auth (Supabase Auth)

**Purpose:** identity and access control.

**Supports**

- Email/password auth
- Optional wallet‑based sign‑in (Solana/Ethereum) when configured
- Automatic profile row creation (recommended via trigger)

### 5) Support Site (Public Docs)

**Purpose:** public documentation and system info, accessible without login.

**Includes**

- Product overview (this page)
- Guides & runbooks
- Privacy & security notes
- Status pages & troubleshooting

## Current Updates by Module

### Dashboard Updates

- Improved build stability for monorepo deployments
- Fixed UI issues causing missing component compile errors
- Ongoing: mobile navigation improvements (bottom bar conflicts with browser UI)

### Worker Updates

- Added environment‑based config support (service DID, endpoints)
- Improved publishing checks and clearer errors (ex: invalid service URL)
- Ongoing: handling “no connected Bluesky account” cases cleanly

### Database Updates

- Multi‑user RLS implemented across core tables
- Added audit/event logging for traceability
- Ongoing: schema drift fixes (ex: missing `feeds.title` in older DBs — handled via safe migrations)

### Auth Updates

- Email sign‑in supported now
- Wallet auth enabled in Supabase settings (but requires client‑side wallet connector + SIWE/SIWS flows)
- Ongoing: cleaner mobile UX for wallet prompts and fallback behavior

### Infrastructure Updates

- Feed service identity routes added (`/.well-known/did.json`, `/healthz`)
- Render custom domain wired (feeds.ba6-bsky-suite.com)
- Added version endpoint for debugging deploys (`/__version`)

### Support Site Updates

- Nextra docs site deployed publicly at support.ba6-bsky-suite.com
- Ongoing: better homepage, guides, and an operational “Status” page that checks live endpoints

## Quick Start (for new users)

1. Create an account (email login)
2. Add a Bluesky account (app password or token)
3. Write drafts
4. Schedule posts
5. Monitor execution in Overview + Events

---

## Quick Version (one page)

- **Schedule posts** and let BA6 execute them reliably.
- **Connect Bluesky accounts** to control where posts go.
- **Indexing keeps feeds deterministic** — only known posts appear.
- **Events tell you what happened** when something fails.

If something looks empty, check **sources → indexing → rules**.

## Models (Operational Building Blocks)

BA6 ships as a set of operational building blocks (“models”) you can combine.

- **Scheduler Model** — time‑based execution with retries
- **Queue Model** — claim/lock pattern for safe concurrency
- **Audit Model** — events + traceability
- **Workspace Model** — multi‑user isolation with RLS
- **Status Model** — health + version endpoints for monitoring
