# Spaces

Spaces are the home screen for BA6. Each Space bundles chat, threads, a digest feed, and member controls under a single, shared set of gates.

## What a Space includes

- **Chat** for quick updates and coordination  
- **Threads** for longer discussions  
- **Digest** for curated, rules-based highlights  
- **Members** to manage access  
- **Settings** for join mode, invites, and gates

## Gates apply to actions, not viewing

Gates in BA6 **do not restrict viewing a Bluesky feed**. They restrict BA6 actions, such as:

- joining a Space  
- sending messages  
- creating threads  
- configuring the Digest  
- inviting members  

This is “pay-to-participate,” not “pay-to-read.”

## Join modes

- **Public**: anyone can join  
- **Moderated**: join requests must be approved  
- **Invite only**: requires a code from an admin

## Mobile wallets (iPhone / Android)

Mobile Safari/Chrome usually **cannot detect** MetaMask/Phantom because those browsers don’t support wallet injection.

On mobile, use one of:
- **MetaMask in-app browser** (opens BA6 inside MetaMask)
- **Phantom in-app browser** (opens BA6 inside Phantom)
- **WalletConnect (EVM)** when enabled
- **Magic** wallets (email/social) if supported

If you see “no wallet detected” on mobile, it usually means you’re in Safari/Chrome. Open BA6 inside the wallet app browser instead.
