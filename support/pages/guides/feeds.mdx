# How Bluesky Feeds Work in BA6

A custom Bluesky feed is **not** a live search and **not** a real‑time scan of the entire network.

In BA6, a feed is a deterministic pipeline with four stages:

1. **Source selection** — whose posts are eligible
2. **Indexing** — which posts BA6 knows about
3. **Filtering rules** — which indexed posts qualify
4. **Feed delivery** — how Bluesky requests and displays results

If any stage returns nothing, the feed is empty. This is expected behavior, not a bug.

---

## 1) Feed Sources: defining *who* the feed watches

Every BA6 feed starts by defining **sources**.

A source is usually:

- a Bluesky account (DID)
- added manually or automatically when the feed is created

Examples:

- “Only my posts”
- “These 25 journalists”
- “This curated list of accounts”

Internally, BA6 stores sources as a list of account DIDs tied to the feed.

**Important rule**
If a feed has no valid sources, it returns nothing. Feeds never default to “everything on Bluesky.”

This prevents accidental global feeds and keeps behavior predictable.

---

## 2) Indexing: how BA6 learns about posts

Feeds do **not** query Bluesky live every time someone opens them.

Instead, BA6 maintains an **index** — a database of posts it has already seen.

### How posts enter the index

There are two paths:

#### A) Scheduled posts (immediate)

When you post through the BA6 scheduler:

1. BA6 publishes the post to Bluesky
2. BA6 immediately records it in the index
3. The post appears in relevant feeds right away

This path is instant and guaranteed.

#### B) Manual posts (background sync)

When you post directly in the Bluesky app:

1. The post exists on Bluesky
2. BA6 does **not** see it instantly
3. A background indexer periodically checks your account
4. New posts are pulled in and added to the index

This usually happens within a few minutes, depending on system load.

---

## 3) Feed rules: deciding *which* posts qualify

Once posts are indexed, feed rules determine what appears.

### Keyword rules (most common)

Example rule:

- Keyword: `trump`
- Case‑insensitive
- Applied only to posts from the feed’s sources

What this means:

- The feed shows **posts by the selected accounts**
- **Only if the post text contains the keyword**

If no rules are defined:

- The feed shows **all indexed posts** from the sources

Rules never expand the feed beyond its sources.

---

## 4) Feed delivery: how Bluesky gets the feed

When someone opens your feed in Bluesky:

1. Bluesky calls BA6’s feed endpoint using the AT Protocol
2. BA6:
   - identifies the feed by its slug
   - loads the feed’s sources and rules
   - queries the index
   - returns a list of post URIs
3. Bluesky fetches the full post content and displays it

BA6 does **not** send post text or media to Bluesky — only references. This keeps feeds fast and scalable.

---

## Why feeds can appear “empty”

An empty feed does **not** mean something is broken.

Common reasons:

- No sources are configured
- Sources exist but no posts are indexed yet
- Keyword rules don’t match recent posts
- Manual posts haven’t been indexed yet

In all cases, the feed is behaving correctly based on its configuration.

---

## Scheduler vs Feed (important distinction)

| Feature | Scheduler | Feed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publishes posts | Yes | No |
| Indexes posts | Yes (immediate) | No |
| Shows posts | No | Yes |
| Reads from Bluesky | No | Yes (via index) |

The scheduler **creates** posts. Feeds **observe** posts that already exist.

---

## Why BA6 uses indexing instead of live search

This design is intentional:

- Predictable results
- No rate‑limit explosions
- Lower latency
- No accidental global scraping
- Clear user control over sources

It also enables future upgrades without changing feed behavior.

---

## Current scope vs future expansion

### Current (Level 2)

- Feeds watch **curated account lists**
- Posts are pulled via standard Bluesky RPC calls
- Ideal for topic tracking with high signal

### Future (Level 3)

- Feeds can ingest the **network‑wide firehose**
- Same rules, same UI
- Only the ingestion layer changes

Your feed logic does not need to change to support this later.

---

## Mental model to remember

**Feeds don’t watch Bluesky. Feeds watch what BA6 has indexed from Bluesky.**

If a post isn’t indexed yet, it doesn’t exist to the feed.

# Quick Version (One Page)

- **A feed shows posts from specific sources.** If no sources, it’s empty.
- **BA6 only shows posts it has indexed.** Scheduled posts index instantly; manual posts index in the background.
- **Rules filter the indexed posts.** Rules never expand beyond your sources.
- **Bluesky requests a list of post URIs.** BA6 doesn’t send post text, only references.

If your feed is empty, check **sources → indexing → rules** in that order.

---

# For Non‑Technical Creators

Think of a feed like a **playlist**:

- **Sources = the artists you’re following**
- **Index = the songs you’ve downloaded**
- **Rules = your filters (only upbeat, only acoustic, etc.)**
- **Feed delivery = the music player showing the playlist**

If the playlist is empty, it’s usually because:

- you didn’t add any artists,
- you haven’t downloaded anything yet, or
- your filters are too strict.

The fix is simple: add sources, give the indexer a few minutes, and loosen rules if needed.

# Mobile wallets (iPhone / Android)

Mobile Safari/Chrome usually **cannot detect** MetaMask/Phantom because those browsers don’t support wallet injection.

On mobile, use one of:
- **MetaMask in-app browser** (opens BA6 inside MetaMask)
- **Phantom in-app browser** (opens BA6 inside Phantom)
- **WalletConnect (EVM)** when enabled
- **Magic** wallets (email/social) if supported

If you see “no wallet detected” on mobile, it usually means you’re in Safari/Chrome. Open BA6 inside the wallet app browser instead.
