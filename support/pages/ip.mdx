## 2) Terms of Service — Intellectual Property section (copy/paste)

**Intellectual Property**

BA6 retains all rights to the BA6 software, source code, configuration, documentation, feed generation logic, ranking algorithms, gating mechanisms, derived datasets, and analytics. Branding, feed names, and product names are owned by BA6.

Users retain ownership of their content. BA6 does not claim ownership of user‑generated Bluesky posts or third‑party content. By using BA6, users grant a limited, non‑exclusive license for BA6 to process and index public posts solely for feed generation and system operation.

Token‑gated or pay‑gated access provides access to BA6 features and does not convey ownership, equity, or profit rights in BA6.

Users may not reverse‑engineer, copy, or redistribute BA6 proprietary systems or use them to create competing services.

## 3) U.S. copyright registration checklist

**What to register**

- Software + documentation (as a single work)
- Feed generator logic and ranking modules
- Gating systems (token/pay gate workflows)

**Where to file**

- U.S. Copyright Office online system

**Category**

- “Literary Work” (software + documentation)

**What to submit**

- A versioned PDF of key documentation (overview, architecture)
- A partial source code deposit (see below)

**Partial source code deposit**

- Provide the first 25 pages and last 25 pages of source code
- Redact trade secrets if needed
- Maintain clear version tags or commit hashes

**When to register**

- Optional before public launch
- Recommended once the system becomes stable and revenue‑bearing

**Benefits**

- Public record of ownership
- Eligibility for statutory damages in U.S. enforcement
- Clear proof of authorship and date of creation

---

## 4) Patent strategy (optional / defensive)

**Usually not patentable**

- Standard scheduling workflows
- Common feed filtering patterns
- General database indexing logic

**Potentially patentable (if novel)**

- A unique ranking model tied to social signals
- A gating mechanism that combines on‑chain and off‑chain states in a novel way
- A specific algorithmic flow for feed curation at scale

**Provisional patent (optional)**

- Low‑cost way to establish a priority date
- Useful if you believe a novel mechanism is commercially critical

**Decision framework**

- **File now** if the system includes a truly novel algorithm with clear business value
- **File later** if the idea is still evolving
- **Do not file** if the system is mainly standard infrastructure or operational tooling

---

## 5) Additional protections

**Trade secrets**

- Keep proprietary ranking logic private
- Limit access to sensitive configuration and scoring parameters

**Licensing strategy**

- Closed source for core engine
- Source‑available or dual‑license for non‑critical components

**Trademarks**

- “BA6 Bluesky Suite”
- Feed brand names
- Logos and visual identity

**API access controls**

- Rate limits
- Keyed access for partner clients
- Audit logs for suspicious usage

**Contractual protections**

- Terms that forbid scraping of internal outputs
- Clauses that restrict reverse‑engineering

---

## 6) Core principle

You are protecting systems, computation, and structure — **not speech**.  
BA6 never claims ownership of user content; it protects the infrastructure that makes the feeds possible.
