# Terms of Service

**BA6 Bluesky Suite**  
*Last updated: January 29, 2026*

## 1. Overview

BA6 Bluesky Suite (“BA6,” “we,” “our,” or “the Service”) provides tools for creating, scheduling, and generating custom feeds for the Bluesky social network using the AT Protocol.

By using BA6, you agree to these Terms of Service.

---

## 2. What BA6 Does (and Does Not Do)

BA6:

- Allows users to configure custom feed rules
- Schedules posts on behalf of users
- Indexes public Bluesky posts to generate feeds
- Serves feed results to Bluesky clients via the AT Protocol

BA6 does **not**:

- Own user content
- Modify or censor posts
- Guarantee visibility, reach, or engagement
- Provide investment advice or financial returns

---

## 3. Feed Ownership and Branding

Feeds created through BA6 are hosted and served by BA6 infrastructure.

- Feeds are branded as BA6 feeds unless otherwise stated.
- Users configure feed logic, but BA6 operates the feed service endpoint.
- In the future, BA6 may support user‑owned feed records that still point to BA6 services.

---

## 4. User Responsibilities

You agree not to:

- Use BA6 to violate Bluesky’s Terms of Service
- Attempt to scrape private or restricted content
- Abuse rate limits or system resources
- Use the service for unlawful surveillance or harassment

You are responsible for the feed configurations you create.

---

## 5. Availability and Reliability

BA6 is provided on an **as‑is** and **best‑effort** basis.

We do not guarantee:

- Continuous uptime
- Real‑time indexing
- That any post will appear in a feed immediately or at all

---

## 6. Intellectual Property

BA6 retains all rights to:

- The BA6 software, source code, configuration, and documentation
- Feed generation logic and ranking algorithms
- Token‑gating and pay‑gating mechanisms
- Derived datasets and analytics produced by BA6 systems
- Branding, product names, and feed names

You retain ownership of your content. BA6 does **not** claim ownership of user‑generated Bluesky posts or third‑party content.

By using BA6, you grant a limited, non‑exclusive license for BA6 to process and index public posts for feed generation and system operation.

You agree not to reverse‑engineer, copy, or redistribute BA6’s proprietary systems or use them to create competing services.

Token‑gated or pay‑gated access provides access to BA6 features and does not convey ownership, equity, or rights in BA6.

---

## 7. Tokens and Digital Assets

If BA6 offers a token or digital asset:

- It is intended for utility, access, or support purposes
- It does **not** represent equity, ownership, or profit‑sharing
- No promises of value, yield, or appreciation are made

Participation is optional.

---

## 8. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access if these terms are violated or if required by law.

---

## 9. Changes

These Terms may be updated as the service evolves. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updates.
